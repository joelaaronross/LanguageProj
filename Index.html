                    <p>Often referred to as Golang, it is a programming language designed by Google engineers.
                    It follows the simplicity of ‘C’ in syntax and semantics with some additional features.
                    </p> 
                    Go is a statically typed, compiled language like C++ and Java.
                    <p>The compiler, tools and source code are all free and open source.
                    The Go programming language has seen explosive growth in usage in recent years. 
                    </p>
                    <p></p>

                  <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h3 style="color:red">Pros</h3>
                    <p>The syntax of Go is considered easy and quick to grasp.
                    Go is a really fast language. Because Go is compiled to machine code, it will naturally outperform languages that are 
                    interpreted or have virtual runtimes.</p>
                    <p>Go programs also compile extremely fast, and the resulting binary is very small. 
                    Go’s syntax is small compared to other languages, and it’s easy to learn.
                    Testing support is built into the standard library.
                    <p>There is no need for an extra dependency. 
                    If you have a file called thing.go, write your tests in another file called thing_test.go, and run “go test”.
                    Go will execute these tests fast.</p>
                </p> <br />
                    <p>
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h3 style="color:red">Cons</h3> 
                    <p>Go doesn’t have generics. This is a big hurdle to get over when coming from languages like Java. 
                        It means a decreased level of reuse in your code. This hurts productivity and maintainability.
                        <p>Library support for Go is spotty. 
                          The API integrates with Contentful, which does not have an officially supported Go SDK.</p>
